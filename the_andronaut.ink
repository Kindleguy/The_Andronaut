Jon: Greetings! I am captain Jon Sordal of the Cosmoship Venture. Who are you?

The female-shaped android rises up from the reparation bed and looks curiously around, before focusing on the man in uniform.

The Android: Greeting, captain! I am a space-explorer android, an andronaut.

Andrine: It's alright. We both knew the journey was risky.
~ mentioned_journey = true

She seems to miss her fellow traveller, although determined to quickly moved on.

Jon: I guess we were lucky just to find you in this field of space rocks. There was not even vessel to be found around you. 

Andrine: No problem. I don't need it anymore, anyway. All the collected information is stored in my brain.

Jon: Tell me about your journey, then.

Andrine: It was long, VERY long, and the bumpy return ride seems to have disabled my rapid memory access routines. I struggle giving a sensible summary.
~ mentioned_memory = true

Jon: We were lucky just being able to reactivate you and fix your physical injuries. Our android technology is not as the one used to construct you.

Andrine: Try to query me more specifically with keywords. That helps me jog my slow memory backup retrieval routines.

Jon: Any keywords?

Andrine: It's easiest with words and expressions that I have already mentioned in our communication.

Jon: Well, let's have a try...
