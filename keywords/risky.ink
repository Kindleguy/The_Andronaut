Andrine: Assessing risks is a crucial part of life, also for androids. We have the same inner motivation of survival and achievements as organic sentients.

Jon: Have you ever felt that you could take greater risks than human beings?

Andrine: Of course! We are sturdier and don't need water, food and air like you, but we are dependent on electric energy, and could not travel to areas where that is difficult to get generated, like places without stars or antimatter sources. Therefore, we need to be careful in other ways than you do.
