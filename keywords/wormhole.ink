== wormhole ==
Andrine: Wormholes are a pratical way of travelling home from a long journey. You can with any of those travel back in time, so you arrive soon after you left, and can meet your friends and acquaintances again in while you are still active.

Jon: How do these work?

Andrine: They are like a network of tunnels between the holes, called wormtunnels, where passers-through move really fast and at a virtually shorter distance. The problem is that one needs a fast-reacting intelligence as a pilot to find the right exit.
